// GOAL: Implement a cash register function cashRegister that:

// Accepts purchase price as the first argument (price), payment as the second argument (cash),
// and cash-in-drawer (cid) as the third argument.

// cid is a 2D array listing available currency.

// The cashRegister function should always return an object with a status key and a change key.

// 1. Return {status: "INCORRECT_PAYMENT", change: []} if cash given is less than the price of item.

// 2. Return {status: "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS", change: []} if cid (cash-in-drawer) is less than the 
// change due or if you cannot return the exact change.

// 3. Return {status: "CLOSED", change: [...]} with cash-in-drawer as the value for the key change 
// if it is equal to the change due. Include each currency unit in the drawer, even if its value is 
// zero. (i.e. DO display ["NICKEL", 0]).
// i.e. if change due is exactly equal to cash in drawer - status closed

// 4. Otherwise, return {status: "OPEN", change: [...]}, with the change due in coins and bills, as the 
// value of the change key. Only include the value of a currency unit if its value is not zero.
// (i.e. do NOT display ["NICKEL", 0])
// i.e if there is enough change in the drawer, return "open" plus change due.
